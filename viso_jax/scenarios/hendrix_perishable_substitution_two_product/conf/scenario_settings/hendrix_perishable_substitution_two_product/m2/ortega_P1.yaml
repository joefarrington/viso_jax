# No overrides, the base settings are for m=2, exp1, which is the same as Ortega P1
# except for the minimum number of iterations.
# Max order quantities differ from those in Table 3 of Ortega et al (2019)
# but reported order quantities and N states appear not to match up so have
# assumed max order quantity in that Table is actually number of possible actions
# (i.e. max order quantity + 1) because this interpretation is consistent with N states

# Max order quantities differ from those in Table 3 of Ortega et al (2019)
# but reported order quantities and N states appear not to match up so have
# assumed max order quantity in that Table is actually number of possible actions
# (i.e. max order quantity + 1) because this interpretation is consistent with N states
